# Nimbus
A simple web application powered by Express and NodeJS that fetches random songs from the SoundCloud library using the SoundCloud API.

# Dependencies
Nimbus uses a few packages to help this run on a machine. Some of the dependencies includes:
* Express - it is a web application after all.
* Babel - mainly to support older browsers if you need it.
* Webpack - bundles modules together.

# How to Run
After you make sure that all the dependencies are included, run:
```
node ./routes/appjs
```
If you have made any changes to the modules, make sure to run:
```
webpack
```
